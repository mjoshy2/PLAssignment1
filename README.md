# Programming Languages Assignment 1

For this assignment we will use three different languages. One has to be a statically typed language. One has to be a dynamically typed language. A third is your choice. Do not pick two languages that are too similar to each other.

Create files using proper extensions. Also create either a build file or a sh file that will compile (if necessary) and run your code to display the output or show test results automatically.

If you need help with any of the steps, please ask. You do not have to fight with tools or code for a long time. The purpose of this course is to learn. If you're stuck, then ask for help and it will be given. If you start early, you will be able to make much better progress than if you start late.

Given the following names, as an example,

Abdon, Brandon, Christopher, Daniel, Denys, Diego, Edrienne, Eugene, Ezequiel, Gustavo, Houtan, Jeffry, Lina, Luis, Martin, Matthew, Mike, Naresh, Nicolas, Patricio, Pio, Rachel, Ravali, Samad, Shaneej, Shara, Sikender, Tommy, Venkat, Victor, Zachary

write a program to 

1. use mutability and imperative style to compute the average number of letters in the names.

2. use mutability and imperative style to compute the number of names starting  with each letter (don't include a letter if no name stars with it).

3. use immutability and functional style to compute the average number of letters in the names.

4. use immutability and functional style to compute the number of names starting with each letter (don't include a letter if no name stars with it).

Keep the printing of the results separate from the code/function that does the actual work and returns the result.
